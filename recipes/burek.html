    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Burek, also spelled börek, is a filled pastry made with flaky phyllo dough. It is believed that burek originated from what is now ​Turkey in the old Ottoman Empire. Since its creation, burek has become a very popular dish in North Africa, the Balkans, and even Southern Slavic countries. Given its international footprint, burek has been adapted to different cuisines.
