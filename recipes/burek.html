    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Burek, also spelled börek, is a filled pastry made with flaky phyllo dough. It is believed that burek originated from what is now ​Turkey in the old Ottoman Empire. Since its creation, burek has become a very popular dish in North Africa, the Balkans, and even Southern Slavic countries. Given its international footprint, burek has been adapted to different cuisines. 
        It is available with a variety of fillings and flavors and may be prepared as individual pastries or in a large pan and cut after baking.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil
        </li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, peeled and chopped
        </li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Hungarian paprika
        </li>
        <li>Salt, to taste
        </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
        </li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) box phyllo pastry sheets, 12 x 17 inches
        </li>
        <li>3/4 cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium-low to medium heat and add the oil.</li>
        <li>Sauté the onion until soft and then add the ground beef, allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook until the meat is crumbly but not dry. Cool completely before you continue. While ground beef mixture is cooling, preheat oven to 375 F.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, lay one sheet of phyllo dough on the counter. Keep the remaining sheets of phyllo dough covered with a damp kitchen towel, and work quickly to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>Brush sheet with some of the melted butter. Place a heaping 1/3 cup of meat mixture on the sheet along the long side, 2 inches from the edge.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom over the meat mixture and roll into a snake shape. Cut the roll in half and coil each roll into a snail shape.</li>
        <li>Place rolled dough and ground beef pinwheel on a nonstick baking sheet and butt the end up against the edge of the pan to prevent uncoiling. Brush with additional butter. Continue until you've used all the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes or until just golden.</li>
    </ol>
