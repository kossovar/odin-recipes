    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>The casing-less Balkan sausages known as or cevapi, cevaps, or cevapcici found their way into Eastern Europe via the Ottoman Empire, which in turn picked them up from Arabic traditions. Today, there are different versions of these fresh, unsmoked sausages throughout Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck
        </li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork
        </li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground lamb
        </li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped, or more to taste
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
        </li>
        <li>Finely sliced onions, for garnish
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the beef, pork, lamb, garlic, chopped onions, and salt until thoroughly combined. Using disposable gloves to knead the mixture makes the process easier and also helps the ingredients combine thoroughly.</li>
        <li>To taste for seasonings, make a small patty and fry. Taste and add more garlic, salt, or onions to the raw mixture according to your preferences. Refrigerate the meat mixture for at least one hour, but ideally overnight, â€‹before forming.</li>
        <li>To make the sausages, roll the meat mixture into a long, 3/4-inch cylinder. Cut links at 4-inch intervals. If you'd prefer, you can use a sausage extruder without a casing attached.</li>
        <li>Place the sausages on a plastic wrap-lined plate, cover with more plastic wrap, and refrigerate for an extra hour to firm.</li>
        <li>Broil cevapcici on a charcoal grill or a heated oven broiler rack coated with cooking spray 4 to 6 inches from the flame for 4 minutes per side or until no longer pink in the middle. The sausages can also be pan-fried in a large skillet coated with cooking spray over high heat for a total of 8 minutes, turning frequently to brown on all sides. Serve with chopped raw onion.</li>
        
    </ol>
