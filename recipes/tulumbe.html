    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This recipe for tulumbe is a very sweet and popular dessert in the Balkans, one whose preparation dates back to the end of the 18th century, and has long been part of Ottoman cuisine. The batter is similar to a French pâte à choux dough, and the appearance is similar to an unfilled, unglazed eclair. They're also not too dissimilar from Mexican churros—except those are crispier, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, and sometimes served with a dipping sauce. But honestly, tulumbe is its own thing. The similarities typically (although not always) end there, as variations of this pastry can be found from Greece to Iran under many different names; in the latter country, they go by bamiyeh.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the Syrup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>Make the Syrup:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, bring the sugar, 4 cups water, vanilla extract, and lemon juice to a boil. Reduce heat and cook down for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely and then divide into two large bowls.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 425 F. In a medium saucepan, melt butter in 1 1/2 cups water.</li>
        <li>Add flour and salt, and stir until dough forms a mass that cleans the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the batter is smooth.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake the Pastries:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip with dough and pipe 12 (5-inch) lengths onto the prepared pan. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the tulumbe puff up and turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Place hot tulumbe into two bowls of syrup, pushing down lightly to completely coat them. Soak overnight and serve cold the next day.</li>
    </ol>
